    <h1>Form fields with custom labeling</h1>
    <h2>Simple examples</h2>
    <p><strong>Note:</strong> You could potentially use a fieldset/legend structure here instead of a heading, but I'm
        using headings instead for simplicity.</p>
    <p>(rjc): FYI: legend elements can now have heading elements as children.
<br>&lt;legend&gt;&lt;h2&gt;this text is announced as a legend and also can be used for navigation by headings&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/legend&gt;
</p>
<p>Each input field has aria-labelledby set, referencing the IDs of:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The text preceding it,</li>
        <li>A hidden (display:none) div element, with its inner text reading "blank," near the end of the DOM
            (aria-labelledby can reference hidden content under certain circumstances, which is by design), and</li>
        <li>The text following it.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Note that <strong>all IDs on the page must be unique.</strong></p>
    <p>Also note that the first option in the &lt;select&gt; element below is an actual value. The reason is that
        blank values in selects can cause undesirable behavior in some screen readers.</p>
    <p><strong>Update 3/21: </strong>Question 3 in this section references a "blank" element nested in the middle of
        the sentence, rather than a global one. The inner text of this changes depending on what the user has typed
        into the input field. If the user erases their input, the inner text goes back to being "blank"</p>
<p>(rjc): using wrapped labels and placeholder attributes is a far simpler way of doing this.
It avoids having to use unique global IDs, the code is shorter and more easily read, and who knows -- it may actually work with VoiceOver!
</p><p>
<em>You may have to fix any visual styles / effects</m>, but I've rewritten the first three examples using wrapped labels and it works perfectly with NVDA+Firefox.
I'm sure Jaws will have no issues as well.
Wrapped labels were introduced in HTML 3 I believe, removed in 4.x, and brought back in HTML5!
</p>

    <ol>
<li><label>
the <input type="text" placeholder="blank"> has a greater than average weight.
</label></li>
        <li><label>A <select >
                <option value="selectsomething">---</option>
                <option value="jeep">Jeep</option>
                <option value="elephant">Shuttlecraft</option>
                <option value="pteranodon">Pteranodon</option>
            </select>
            is a highly-efficient mode of transportation.</label>
        </li>
        <li>
            <span id="preceding_03">A </span><span id="blank_03" class="sronly mid-blank">blank</span>
            <input type="text" aria-labelledby="preceding_03 blank_03 following_03" data-blank="blank_03">
            <span id="following_03"> is not a highly-efficient mode of transportation.</span>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <!-- Hidden div containing the word 'blank.' Aria-labelledby can reference this despite it being hidden. (note that this may not work if you nest the text within *another* element inside the .hide div.) -->
    <!-- You can use this single element to cover all cases where the word "blank" is needed. -->
    <div class="hide" id="blank">blank</div>
    <hr aria-hidden="true">
    <h2>Hackier/more complex examples</h2>
    <h3>Using absolute positioning to modify the visual order</h3>
    <p>This example has a sentence that contains the word "blank" as screen reader-only text. The input field or select
        is placed visually over top of the "blank" area, and is labeled in such a way to make it read "Enter [select]
        answer for: [question]."</p>
    <p>(rjc): again, a wrapped label and placeholder will make the screen reader do what you want.
I have no idea what your trying to do visually!
I did not modify...
</p>
<p>I used JavaScript to dynamically place each answer field over the blank spot, but this is probably breakable.
        One major issue (at least with what I was able to code) was that any field/select that isn't on the first line
        of text in the question doesn't get positioned correctly.</p>
    <p>These double-speak in NVDA when using browse mode/jumping between list items.</p>
    <p>In this case, I had to take the question out of a list structure because the list numbers/bullets were getting
        styled as though they were an entire line above the question, which is something I don't have the CSS skills to
        fix. I used the ARIA list/listitem roles to provide a semantic list structure.</p>

    <div role="list">

        <div role="listitem" class="relative hasinput answerContainer">
            <div id="complex_01" class="absolute">1. The <span class="blankspace"><span class="sronly">blank</span></span>
                seen above Los Angeles in
                March 2019 went viral on Twitter.</div>
            <input id="complex_01_field" type="text" class="absolute blankspace-input" aria-label="Enter answer for this question"
                aria-labelledby="complex_01 complex_01_field">
        </div>
        <div role="listitem" class="relative hasinput answerContainer">
            <div id="complex_02" class="absolute">2. The thing seen above Los Angeles in
                March 2019 that went viral on Twitter also was <span class="blankspace"><span class="sronly">blank</span></span>
                on Instagram.</div>
            <select id="complex_02_field" class="absolute blankspace-input" aria-label="Select answer for this question"
                aria-labelledby="complex_02 complex_02_field">
                <option value="selectSomething">select from the options below</option>
                <option value="shown">shown</option>
                <option value="freaking-people-out">freaking people out</option>
                <option value="not">not</option>
            </select>
        </div>

    </div>
    <h3>Adding buttons to speak the answer</h3>
    <p>These are constructed like the ones shown under "Simple examples," but include a button after each one to read
        out the user's computed answer.</p>
    <p>The first example here utilizes an aria-live region that is screen reader-only and located at the bottom of the
        DOM. The region is present, but empty, on page load. When the user activates the "speak" button, the computed
        answer is appended into the live region, then removed after 10 seconds. This is probably not a great solution,
        though, because it will only work for screen reader users.</p>
    <p>The second example uses the speech synthesis API, which will not work in IE11, and might interupt a screen
        reader.</p>
