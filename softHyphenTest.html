  <h1>Hooray for Hyphen&shy;ation</h1>
  <p>This text contains some Hyphen&shy;ation. Hope&shy;fully it is not in&shy;com&shy;pre&shy;hen&shy;sible. Usually NVDA can process soft hyphens in documents pretty well, but did you notice the previous word "incomprehensible"?</p>
  <p>Pay attention to the word "pronunciation", which is pronunced differently with soft hyphens in it:</p>
  <p><strong>With: </strong> "pro&shy;nun&shy;cia&shy;tion"</p>
  <p><strong>Without:</strong> "pronunciation"</p>
  <h2>Pro&shy;nun&shy;cia&shy;tion is the key to under&shy;standing the spoken word</h2>
  <p><strong>Did you know?</strong> Soft hyphens have been around since the 80s!</p>  
  <p>The next heading does not contain hyphens.</p>
  <h2>Pronunciation is the key to understanding the spoken word</h2>
  <p>It's a pitty hyphenation cannot be reliably applied via CSS.</p>
